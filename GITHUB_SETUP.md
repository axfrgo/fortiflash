# Pushing FortiFlash to GitHub

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `fortiflash` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: `FortiFlash - AI-Powered Video Watermark Remover & Enhancer`
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Add GitHub Remote and Push

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fortiflash.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Alternative: Using SSH
If you prefer SSH:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/fortiflash.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
